# CSS Selectors Lab

## Description

In this lab you'll learn how to add styling to html tags using references called "selectors". With selectors you can change the style of many html tags with a single styling rule.

Instructions:

Open `StyledPage.html` and complete the missing CSS rules in the <style> section.

You will practice these selectors:

- Element selectors (p, h1, etc.)

- Class selectors (.classname)

- ID selectors (#idname)

- Attribute selectors ([type="text"], [href^="https"])

- Pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child, :nth-of-type)
